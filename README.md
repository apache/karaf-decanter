# Apache Karaf Decanter

Apache Karaf Decanter is a complete monitoring platform for Apache Karaf.
It is very extensible, flexible, easy to install and use.

## Overview

* **Collectors**: The collectors are responsible of harvesting monitoring data.
    Two kinds of collectors are available:
      * the polling collectors are invoked periodically by a scheduler
      * the event driven collectors react to some events.
    It's very dynamic (thanks to the OSGi services), so it's possible to add
    a new custom collector (user/custom implementations).
* **Dispatcher**: The dispatcher is called by the scheduler or the event driven collectors
    to dispatch the collected data to the appenders.
* **Appenders**: The appenders are responsible to send/store the collected data to target
    backend systems.
* **Processor**: The processors can manipulate the internal Decanter events between the 
    collectors and the appenders. Decanter provides ready to use processors (aggregate,
    groupBy, camel, ...).
* **Alerting**: the alerting layer provides a checker, responsible of testing values of
      harvested data (coming from the collectors) and send alerts when the data
      is not in the expected state.

## Getting Started

Apache Karaf Decanter is available as a Karaf features. The following command registers
the Karaf Decanter features repository.

```
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add decanter
```

Depending of what you want to monitor and collect, you have to install the corresponding features
using `feature:install` command.
