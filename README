Welcome to Apache Karaf Decanter
================================
Apache Karaf Decanter is a complete monitoring platform for Apache Karaf.
It is very extensible, flexible, easy to install and use.

Apache Karaf Decanter is composed into:
    * Collectors and SLA Policies
      The collectors are OSGi services responsible of harvesting monitoring data.
      Two kinds of collectors are available:
      - the polling collectors are invoked periodically by a scheduler
      - the event driven collectors react to some events.
      It's very dynamic (thanks to the OSGi services), so it's possible to add
      a new custom collector (user/custom implementations).
      The collectors are also responsible of checking the SLA, and delegate to
      a notifier.
    * Scheduler
      The scheduler service is responsible to call the Polling Collectors,
      gather the harvested data, and delegate to the dispatcher.
    * Dispatcher
      The dispatcher is called by the scheduler or the event driven collectors
      to dispatch the collected data to the appenders.
    * Appenders
      The appenders are responsible to send/store the collected data to target
      systems.
    * Notifier
      The notifier is called by the collectors' SLA. The notifier uses external
      system to "publish" the SLA alert.
    * Console & Web UI
      The console is responsible of both SLA configuration and dashboard view.
