Welcome to Apache Karaf Decanter
================================
Apache Karaf Decanter is a complete monitoring platform for Apache Karaf.
It is very extensible, flexible, easy to install and use.

Apache Karaf Decanter is composed into:
    * Collectors and SLA Policies
      The collectors are OSGi services responsible of harvesting monitoring data.
      Two kinds of collectors are available:
      - the polling collectors are invoked periodically by a scheduler
      - the event driven collectors react to some events.
      It's very dynamic (thanks to the OSGi services), so it's possible to add
      a new custom collector (user/custom implementations).
      The collectors are also responsible of checking the SLA, and delegate to
      a notifier.
    * Scheduler
      The scheduler service is responsible to call the Polling Collectors,
      gather the harvested data, and delegate to the dispatcher.
    * Dispatcher
      The dispatcher is called by the scheduler or the event driven collectors
      to dispatch the collected data to the appenders.
    * Appenders
      The appenders are responsible to send/store the collected data to target
      systems.
    * Notifier
      The notifier is called by the collectors' SLA. The notifier uses external
      system to "publish" the SLA alert.
    * Console & Web UI
      The console is responsible of both SLA configuration and dashboard view.

Getting Started
===============
Apache Karaf Decanter is available as a Karaf features. The commands below start 
the jmx collector, log collector and an appender to a local elasticsearch instance
on the default port. Prerquisite is a running elasticsearch instance.

feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.decanter/apache-karaf-decanter/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
feature:install decanter-simple-scheduler decanter-collector-jmx decanter-collector-log decanter-appender-elasticsearch 

Features
========

Alternatively you can install exactly the features you need.

* decanter-simple-scheduler
  Very simple Decanter Scheduler that polls collectors in a fixed time interval.

* decanter-collector-log
  Collector listening for all log messages happening in Karaf.

* decanter-collector-jmx
  Collector harvesting the JMX MBeans metrics (local or remote).

* decanter-collector-camel
  Collector based on the JMX one, but specific to Camel routes metric collection.

* decanter-appender-log
  Appender that sends the collected data as log messages.

* decanter-appender-elasticsearch
  Appender that sends the collected data to a Elasticsearch database.

* decanter-appender-jdbc
  Appender that sends the collected data to a JDBC database.
